### Payload/Testing

#### Achieving maximum power

At first we'll need to test the optimum number of seconds to spray hairspray in the combustion chamber. What number of seconds will generate maximum combustion and force behind the potato/raspberrypi?

More hairspray doesn't always mean more power, because the energy equation is  'more energy = more air + more fuel' and with more hairspray, eventually not all of it will combust due to a lack of air. In order to test how many seconds generates the most speed and force of the pi in the sky, we will use a stopwatch and track the time it takes for the projectile to travel a set distance.

### What will the Raspberry Pi do?

The pi will measure acceleration values as it is fired and travels through the air. The raspberry pi will be in a projectile that is cylindrical in shape, because the pi is longer than the barrel diameter, but not as wide as the barrel diameter.

### Timeline - 6 Weeks

#### First two weeks

   1. Build the cannon 
  
   2. Build the ignition mechanism
         - Make sure after the hole(s) is drilled for the sparker wire(s) that the hole is effectively sealed so that the force created in the combustion chamber doesn't                   exit out of the "sealed" ignition hole.

#### Second two weeks
        
   3. Test for the optimum amount of hairspray.
        
   4. Design and build a shell to encase the raspberry pi as it is fired from the cannon and protect it from impact

#### Third two weeks
     
   5. Test the raspberry pi with the projectile to collect acceleration values
        
   6. Find ways to make the design better to increase accuracy, velocity, etc.

### Risk Mitigation

Safety Test Plan -->   First of all, we need to make sure the potato cannon won't explode when it's fired. For the first few tests, we will fire the potato cannon from a distance of at least 15 feet with an obstacl between us and the cannon, until we can be sure of its structural integrity while using increasing amounts of hairspray. For the rest of the tests when we're operating the cannon as it is fired, we will not differ from using the amount of hairspray that was safely tested from a distance.
   
   We will wear safety glasses when we fire the potato cannon, and we'll only fire it outside (obviously) with some open space. For example, we could test it on the field next to the baseball field. We would aim at things with a background of the hill towards Melbourne.
   
   The hairspray will either be transported to and from school, or it will be stored in a secure place at school so that only we can fire it, and no one can just "try it" during the day.
